# Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-College-Majors

In this project I make use of the pandas module as well as matplotlib to analyze data from a survey of recent college graduates and how they are faring in the job market based on what major they took in college. The data was originally compiled by the American Community Survey group and then cleaned up and released by FiveThirtyEight.
